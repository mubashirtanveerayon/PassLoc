# PassLoc

## PassLoc is an open-source password manager app.

**PassLoc** uses a local database to store your private username, password, url and any text that you wish to keep secret. It makes use of the [**sql-cipher**](https://github.com/sqlcipher/sqlcipher) database with a strong and reliable encryption algorithm based on [**Caesar-Cipher**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher) to add an extra layer of security on top of the default provided encryption of the sql-cipher database.<br> **PassLoc does not store any encryption key anywhere.**

**Currently available on windows (~~standalone exe~~), mac (jar) and linux (jar)**
